# My Learning Log ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-v3.8.5-red.svg)
I wrote a web application called Learning Log that will allow users to register topics of interest and make entries in the journal when they learn about each topic. Learning Journal Home Page should describe the site and invite users to register or login in. After logging in, the user will be able to create new themes, add new records, and read and edit existing records.

### How to start the application

1. Download code.
2. To run it on your system in the terminal where the project is located enter:

1) 'pip install virtualenv' # The virtual environment will be established
2) 'virtualenv env' # Then a virtual environment will be created. The virtual environment is called 'env' (you can name it whatever you like)
3) 'env\Scripts\activate' (Windows) # Virtual environment activation
4) 'pip install -r requirements.txt' # Then the dependencies are installed using pip and they will be installed in the virtual environment 'env'
